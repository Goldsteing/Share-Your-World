          <h3>What is a Cutter?</h3>
          <p>A cutter sailboat is a single-masted sailing vessel defined by its rigging, specifically its use of two or more headsails. A jib on the outer forestay and another sail on the inner forestay, supported by a bowsprit.
            This makes it especially well-suited for offshore or long-distance cruising, where conditions can change quickly and reliability is critical.
            The ability to adjust or reduce sails in stages gives sailors more control and safety in heavy weather, which is why cutters are often favored by bluewater sailors for their flexibility, stability, and overall seaworthiness.</p>
