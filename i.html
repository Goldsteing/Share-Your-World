          <h3>What is a Sloop?</h3>
         <p>A sloop is one of the most common and efficient sailboat designs, favored for both cruising and racing 
          due to its simplicity and versatility. Its defining feature is a single mast setup with fore-and-aft rigging, meaning the sails are ali
        gned roughly parallel to the boat's keel line. The standard sail plan for a sloop includes two primary sails: a mainsail located behind the mast and a headsail
         typically a jib or genoaâ€”located in front of the mast, attached to a stay that runs from the bow to a point on the mast.</p>
